HR Analytics: Employee Retention & Attrition Prediction

📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes employee attrition using HR data to identify key factors contributing to turnover. The goal is to uncover insights that can help reduce attrition and improve employee engagement, retention, and productivity.

🎯 Objectives for this project
- Analyze HR data to identify patterns of employee attrition
- Build a machine learning model to predict attrition risk
- Deliver insights through visual dashboards for HR executives
- Demonstrate full-cycle analytics from data to business value

🧠 Key Business Questions I have
- What employee characteristics are associated with high attrition?
- Which departments or job roles have the highest turnover?
- How do satisfaction, work-life balance, and tenure impact attrition?
- Can we predict who is most likely to leave next?

🧰 Tools & Technologies I will be using
- Languages: Python, SQL (optional)
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost
- Dashboards: Power BI or Tableau
- Platform: Jupyter Notebooks + GitHub

📁 Dataset
IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance  
- Source: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)  
- Records: 1,470 employees
- Features include: job role, department, education, age, satisfaction, overtime, salary, years at company, etc.

🔍 Process & Methodology (Lean Six Sigma - DMAIC)
Define
- Identify the business problem: high employee attrition affecting productivity and morale
- Define project scope, stakeholders, and goals (predict and reduce attrition)

Measure
- Collect HR data from public dataset (Kaggle - IBM HR Attrition)
- Validate data quality: check for missing values, consistency, and anomalies
- Establish baseline metrics: attrition rate, department turnover

Analyze
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA): distributions, outliers, correlations
- Identify key drivers of attrition: job role, overtime, satisfaction levels, tenure
- Use statistical tests and data visualization to validate hypotheses

Improve
- Engineer new features to improve model accuracy (e.g., satisfaction scores, tenure buckets)
- Build and evaluate classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Recommend targeted HR strategies based on model outputs (e.g., focus on overtime reduction, improving work-life balance)

Control
- Design Power BI or Tableau dashboards to monitor ongoing attrition trends
- Provide HR with a data-driven framework for continuous improvement
- Create documentation and handoff report with actionable recommendations

📈 Sample Visuals I plan to use for this analysis
- Attrition by Age, Department, and Job Role
- Satisfaction vs Attrition Heatmaps
- ROC Curve of Prediction Model
- Interactive Dashboard filtering by Department or Tenure

🧠 Key Takeaways (to include)
- X% of attrition came from 2 job roles
- Overtime and dissatisfaction were top drivers of attrition
- Prediction model had XX% accuracy (precision-focused)

📄 Future Work
- Integrate synthetic engagement survey data
- NLP on exit interviews (if data available)
- Time-series trend of attrition over months/years
